This repository contains an example of a common ActionScript bug: null pointer exceptions.  The `bug.as` file demonstrates the problematic code that fails when encountering null object properties. The `bugSolution.as` file shows how to safely handle these situations, preventing crashes and ensuring application stability. The core issue is the lack of null checks before accessing object properties.  The solution involves adding explicit checks and providing default values or alternative logic to handle cases where properties are null.
